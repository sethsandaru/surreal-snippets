# The Surreal Snippets

This is my own notes for the usage & development using SurrealDB, a next-generation DB.

## What is SurrealDB?

Check out: https://surrealdb.com/

## My summaries
- Can be used as a traditional DBMS
- Can be used as Key-Value DB
- Various datatypes
  - SCHEMAFULL & SCHEMALESS modes (just like SQL & NoSQL)
- Human-syntax from the SurrealQL
- ACID
- Single Node or Distributed Nodes (scaling)
- On disk or in-memory (single node)
- RPC & Restful APIs
- Built-in Authentication & Authorization
- Various libraries for programming languages...

## Why this repo?

The official documentation is premature and missing a lot of information.

I've spent a lot of time searching on the internet and discord channel. 

I'd note them down here for personal reference & can save you guys time searching as well lol.

## Note
I'm using NodeJS for my development, but it won't be much different comparing to other languages.
